## Branches
There is a branch for each component

## Keeping up-to-date within same branch 
_(when 2 or more push to the same branch)_
* Git pull before you start working
* Inform team member that you pushed content

## Keeping up-to-date with main
* Git pull from main before you start working
* Switch to your branch (not main), then merge main to your branch
* Make sure you are even with main branch

## Merging
* Notify team, push changes to your branch
* Git checkout to "main", then git merge your branch
* Resolve merge changes
* Commit and push - remember to switch back to your branch

## Bugs
Put any found bugs in Github repo, in the _Issues_ tab
